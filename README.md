Project Description: Simulations of future mobility solutions require accurate and granular mobility data. We have identified a shortfall in the accessibility of this data. Previously, researchers had to manually collect mobility data from different sources. While, this is inefficient it is also inconsistent as the type and source of the data varies among different research groups. We aim to improve the situation by presenting a dataset pipeline for automated creation of mobility data. The pipeline includes a collection of locations for which it can output complete datasets - sets that fully characterize the mobility system of that location. Moreover, we propose a novel standard for mobility datasets which consists of four layers: road network, public transport network, additional region specific information and demand.

Usage:
In order to use the application it necessary to clone this repository. Then all the requirements from the file requirements.txt need to be installed. Ideally, this is done in a specific virtual environment. To run the app, simply navigate in the folder proj-sp-conradi-git and execute: python -m proj_sp_conradi
